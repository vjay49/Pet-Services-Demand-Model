# Pet-Services-Demand-Model
**Created a demand model for the pet services industry based on industry factors that <br />
contribute to pet demand for a zip code location. This involves scraping data from industry <br />
sources and creating a weighting systems to rank zip codes relative to each other based on <br />
potential/predicted demand. This model was eventually integrated into Tableau to create a <br />
mapped visual representation of both current and future demand for the industry per location <br />
